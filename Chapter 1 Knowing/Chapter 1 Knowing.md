# Chapter 1: Knowing

Knowledge is the **trigger** to everything in the universe.  

Knowledge of hunger makes us decide to eat.  
Knowledge of cold makes us decide to wear more clothes.  
Knowledge of danger makes us decide to escape or fight.  

Every movement, every choice, every action begins with **knowing**.

## 1.0 Defining “Knowing” in This Book  

Before we go further, it is important to clarify what I mean by “knowing.”  

In everyday language, we often associate knowledge with conscious thought—what humans or intelligent beings can reason about. But in this book, I use the term more broadly:  

**Knowing is any process where a system receives information and changes its state or behavior in response.**  

By this definition:  
- A river “knows” the slope of the earth because it responds to gravity by flowing downhill.  
- A seed “knows” the presence of sunlight because its cells respond biochemically and grow toward it.  
- A child “knows” the difference between comfort and pain because those signals guide behavior.  

This definition is deliberately inclusive. It allows us to see patterns across nature, life, and machines—even if the word “knowing” here is metaphorical. What matters is the **process of response to input**, not whether the system is conscious.

## 1.1 The Three Levels of Knowing  

Knowing itself unfolds across three distinct levels:  

0. **Sourcing** — Receiving or collecting knowledge in its raw form.  
   - Examples: Observing the weather, hearing a sound, reading a sentence for the first time.  

1. **Structuring** — Organizing knowledge into a format we can understand.  
   - Examples: Knowing a language, recognizing a pattern, giving labels and meaning to inputs.  

2. **Connecting** — Linking new knowledge to what we already know, building awareness of context and relationships.  
   - Examples: Understanding how words combine into meaning, relating today’s weather to yesterday’s experience, connecting pain to danger.  

Every system of thought or action begins at these levels: we **source knowledge**, we **structure it**, and then we **connect it** to form deeper understanding.

## 1.2 Knowledge is Iterative and Evolving  

Knowledge is not static—it is **iterative and evolving**.  

When we know it is cold, we decide to wear more clothes. If what we wear isn’t enough, we gain *new knowledge* from that experience. That fresh knowledge tells us to add another layer, and then we test again until we are no longer cold.  

This cycle of **knowing → deciding → acting → knowing again** is what everyone does daily. It is also the **fundamental principle of every system in the universe**.

## 1.3 Sources of Knowledge  

Knowledge arises from three primary sources:  

0. **Direct Input**  
   Raw knowledge received from the outside world.  
   - A sound, a sight, a signal.  
   - An observation not yet connected to any previous flow.  
   - Example: Feeling a drop of rain on your skin.  

1. **Reflection**  
   Knowledge gained from the outcomes of previous actions.  
   - We act, and the result informs us.  
   - Example: Knowing it is cold, wearing more clothes, but still feeling cold. The new knowledge is that the first choice was insufficient, and more must be done.  

2. **Revelation**  
   Knowledge that surfaces into our awareness seemingly from nowhere.  
   - Intuition, inspiration, sudden insight, or dreams.  
   - While many explain this as deeper subconscious processing, it also serves as a **living proof that our known sources of knowledge are limited**.  
   - Revelation reminds us that there may be dimensions of reality and sources of understanding we do not yet fully grasp.  
   - Example: A sudden idea in the middle of the night, or a dream that carries meaning far beyond immediate experience.  

The first two can be studied, structured, and replicated in systems. The third, however, points to the **mystery of the universe**—a reminder that not all knowledge fits within the boundaries we currently perceive.

## 1.4 Structuring Knowledge  

For knowledge to be useful, it must be organized. Structure gives us the ability to build on top of what we know, instead of losing it in scattered fragments.  

Knowledge can be structured in three fundamental ways:  

0. **Prioritizing** — Deciding which knowledge matters more than the rest.  
   - Example: Knowing the difference between background noise and an urgent alarm.  

1. **Sequencing** — Placing knowledge in order of time, cause, or dependency.  
   - Example: Understanding that clouds form before it rains.  

2. **Contextualizing** — Framing knowledge relative to place, situation, or perspective.  
   - Example: Knowing that “it’s hot” means something very different in the desert than in the Arctic.  

When knowledge is prioritized, sequenced, and contextualized, it becomes strong enough to support **decisions** and lead to effective **actions**.

## 1.5 Connecting Knowledge  

Individual pieces of knowledge gain strength when they are **linked together**. But not all connections are the same. Knowledge can be connected in three distinct ways:  

0. **Natural Connection**  
   - Some knowledge is naturally and obviously linked.  
   - Example: The knowledge of *rain* connects directly with the knowledge of *carrying an umbrella*.  

1. **Manual Connection**  
   - Sometimes connections are forced or invented by choice, culture, or creativity.  
   - Example: Linking *tea* to a private joke about a printer. These connections are not natural, but they hold meaning within a specific context or group.  

2. **Contextual Connection**  
   - Knowledge from a previous iteration can combine with new input to form a stronger or deeper understanding.  
   - Example: On the first run, we receive a prompt about *cars*. On the next run, we receive a prompt about *oil*. Now, a contextual connection is formed between *cars* and *oil* because of their relationship across iterations.  

Integration of knowledge through these three modes creates **systems of understanding**. These systems can grow into sciences, cultures, or technologies. At every level, connection multiplies the power of what is known.

Knowledge, therefore, is not just information—it is **perception sourced, structured, and connected into meaning**. Only with such knowledge can decisions and actions arise.
